### Overview

Welcome to our stock clustering project! In this repository, we present a powerful tool for clustering stocks based on VaR (Value at Risk) using the historical method. Our approach utilizes three distinct algorithms: KMeans, Agglomerative, and GMM (Gaussian Mixture Model).

### Algorithms

*   **KMeans:** KMeans is a clustering algorithm that partitions data into K clusters. It works by assigning each data point to the cluster whose mean has the least squared Euclidean distance.
    
*   **Agglomerative:** Agglomerative clustering is a hierarchical clustering method that starts with each data point as a separate cluster and iteratively merges the closest pairs of clusters until only one cluster remains.
    
*   **GMM (Gaussian Mixture Model):** GMM is a probabilistic model that represents a mixture of Gaussian distributions. It is particularly useful for modeling data that may have been generated from a mixture of several subpopulations.
    

### Output

Our project provides valuable insights and outputs for stock analysis:

1.  **Cluster Characteristics:**
    
    *   Understand the characteristics of each cluster formed after applying the clustering algorithms. Each cluster represents a group of stocks with similar risk profiles.
2.  **Stock Cluster Identification:**
    
    *   Identify the cluster to which a specific stock belongs and visualize the daily price diagram for stocks within that cluster.
3.  **Recommended Stocks:**
    
    *   Receive recommendations for stocks that share a similar level of risk based on your preferences. This feature assists in making informed decisions aligned with your risk tolerance.
